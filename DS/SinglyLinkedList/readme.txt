What is a Linked List ? 

A linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science and programming. 
It is a collection of elements, often referred to as nodes, where each node contains two main components:

Head:

The "head" is the first node in a linked list. It contains both data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list.
In a singly linked list, the head marks the beginning of the list, and you can use it to access all the other nodes by following the pointers.
Tail:

The "tail" is the last node in a linked list. Like the head, it contains data and a reference to the next node.
The reference in the tail node typically points to null or an empty value to indicate that it's the end of the list.

Head -> Node 1 -> Node 2 -> Node 3 -> Tail
